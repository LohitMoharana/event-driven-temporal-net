# event-driven-temporal-net
Hardware-based 3-layer SNN prototype (3-2-1 architecture) using discrete 74LS series logic. Features event-driven temporal pattern recognition via 74LS161 integration and 74LS85 thresholding. Validated at 10kHz with asynchronous RC reset loops to mimic biological refractory periods. Developed as a standalone hardware neural inference engine.
